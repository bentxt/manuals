Intro
-----
This manual is about ssh a tool based on public key method in order to securely connect to remote machines


Setup 
-----

### Setup Keys

Setup id files on local machine

	mkdir ~/.ssh
	chmod 0700 ~/.ssh      # rwx only for owner
	cd ~/.ssh
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f mykey -C ben@lekin.org
	chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/*    # rw only for owner

That results in two key files (identity files):

- mykey
- mykey.pub

### Setup Server

Setup id files on remote machine

	scp mykey.pub pn@by.joyent.us:~/
	ssh user@by.joyent.us

	cat ~/mykey.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	rm -rf ~/mykey.pub

## Configure Connection

### Manual Connection

With an ID file 

	ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/mykey pn@by.joyent.us

Or without a password:

	ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey -o "PasswordAuthentication no" -p 22 pn@by.joyent.us

Or put in a config file under ~/.ssh/config

------------------------------------------------
	Host joyent
		HostName by.joyent.us
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mykey
		# PasswordAuthentication no
		Port 22
		User pn 
		
------------------------------------------------


Usage
-----

### Choose password

Although is possible to use passwordless id files, Per default you should define a password. A secure ssh password:

- a sentence with multiple words and spaces
- misspelling of words
- replace chars with numbers
- use punctuation like ',' of '.'

### Changing password

You can change the pass-phrase at any time by using the -p option of ssh-keygen.

	% ssh-keygen -p
	Enter file in which the key is (/homes/ben/.ssh/id_rsa): [RETURN]
	Enter old passphrase: 1amp jumb3d
	Key has comment '/u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa'
	Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase): cow 3ats grass
	Enter same passphrase again: cow 3ats grass
	Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.

The pass-phrases are not echoed as you type them.


## Installation of ssh (server and client)

On Ubuntu/Debian

	sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client
	
SSHD Configuration

The server should now be ready by default. Just test it from your home computer or from same system with the command:

test it:
    ssh localhost

OR
    ssh user@your-server-ip-address

To stop ssh server, enter:

    sudo /etc/init.d/ssh stop

To start sshs server, enter:
